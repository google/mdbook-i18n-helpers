# Changelog

This lists the most important changes between releases of `i18n-helpers`.

## 0.2.0

- Moved to `clap` for command-line argument parsing, which adds more help
  options.
- Added diff mode. This introduces subcommands, so you now have to use the
  `report` subcommand for the original report mode.
